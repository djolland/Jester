# Jester
User Interface Design - High Fidelity Prototype for Final Project Submission.

Jester is an android application that was designed to help users decide where to go out for the night when looking for bars or entertainment. Jester allows users to browse nearby bars, bar specials and events happening at bars. Users will also have the ability to add bars to a list of favorites in order to recieve updates on the latest events and specials.
